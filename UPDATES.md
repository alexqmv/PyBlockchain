# HASHGEN  | BLOCKCHAIN 

# PreHistory

2 days ago __i desided to make a hash generator__...
Many days i was choosing a language on which i'll write the programm.

My choice was between __C++__ and __Python__.

At first I tried to generate a hash randomly, but fortunately I came across one wonderful library.It helped me save a lot of time. Well, then I just wrote __shitcode__ and it turned out)
