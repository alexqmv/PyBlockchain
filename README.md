# HASH GENERATOR ON PYTHON

2 days ago __i desided to make a hash generator__...
Many days i was choosing a language on which i'll write the programm.

At first I tried to generate a hash randomly, but fortunately I came across one wonderful library.It helped me save a lot of time. Well, then I just wrote __shitcode__ and it turned out)

_README.md_ the file will be updated in the future.
